Hello, and welcome to my first post, where I plan to jot down my thoughts after each recording session I did with Ivan, a friend who had never touched Minecraft before. Please watch the video before reading &#8220;Thoughts on the Newbie&#8221;

Firstly, I could say that we were ill-prepared for the recording of the videos. Why? One mistake was that I forgot to set his spawn to the place where he started out in the videos. The original spawn area is a long way from where we started in the video. As such, this meant that when he started dying, I had to teleport him back to the place where he last died. You might ask, why not start from the original spawn? The area near the original spawnÂ is meant for other purposes and should not be touched.

Secondly, using Fraps for recording videos was a bad idea. Although Fraps is a good software for recording high quality videos, it can take a serious toll on your computer&#8217;s resources, resulting in lag during game-play. Another issue I had with Fraps was that after recording, it produced 60-gigabyteÂ video files onÂ computer hard-disk. That&#8217;s a lot of memory taken up for just 45 minutes of recording! Eventually, I had to convert it to save space.

Now, on Thoughts on the Newbie&#8230;

When IvanÂ started the game, he had absolute zero knowledge on Minecraft, not knowing what to do. One example, will be not knowing the tools used to chop down a tree. Watching and guiding him was difficult, because surviving and crafting the basic tools in Minecraft was a natural for those who played the game before. However, watching him die repeatedly in-game and listening to him complain about the game was quite a fun thing to watch. As a result of his zero knowledge on the game, Â I will be joining him in survival mode in the next recording session, hopefully teaching him about the game of Minecraft.
