Hello guys,

We have a new series entitled &#8220;Newbie&#8217;s Impression of Minecraft&#8221; coming up. This series shows the journey of a total Minecraft newbie exploring the world of Minecraft for the 1st time. It will be full of laughter, raging and those random derp moments. The video at the bottom shows BTS from the first few episodes and this will be a bit of what you can expect from this series. Enjoy!
