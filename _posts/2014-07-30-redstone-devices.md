<h1 style="color: #222222;">
  Redstone Devices
</h1>

<p style="color: #222222;">
  These are objects that do something when they receive a redstone signal.
</p>

<h2 id="doors-and-gates" style="color: #222222;">
  Doors and Gates
</h2>

<p style="color: #222222;">
  All doors and gates can be opened and closed using redstone. Iron doors can <em>only </em>be opened with redstone; wooden doors, fence gates and trapdoors can all be opened either by hand or with redstone.
</p>

<p style="color: #222222;">
  Why use an iron door? Because wooden doors can be broken down by zombies if the game difficulty is set to hard, and villagers can open and close wooden doors as well.

    Redstone Lamps
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    Redstone lamps are made from redstone and glowstone, so you need to enter the Nether before you can make them. They light up when switched on by redstone power.
  </p>

      Pistons
    </h2>
  </div>
  
  <p style="color: #222222;">
    Pistons are blocks that extend when activated by redstone power, pushing the block where the piston is facing.
  </p>
  
  <p style="color: #222222;">
    Normal pistons push a block, which then stays in its new position when the piston retracts. However crafting a piston with a slime ball creates a sticky piston, which pulls the block back when the piston retracts.
  </p>
  
  <div class="tagged">
    <h2 id="tnt">
      TNT
    </h2>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    TNT is made from sand and gunpowder: it explodes, with a 4 second fuse, when activated by redstone power. It can also be set off by hitting it with a flint and steel, or by contact with fire.
  </p>
  
  <h2 id="droppers-and-dispensers" style="color: #222222;">
    Droppers and Dispensers
  </h2>
  
  <p style="color: #222222;">
    Droppers and dispensers are similar-looking containers, that can hold nine stacks of items, and release them one at a time when they receive a redstone signal.
  </p>
  
  <div class="tagged">
    <h3 id="droppers">
      <strong>Droppers</strong>
    </h3>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    Droppers either eject items, or feed them into an adjacent container such as a chest or hopper. If an item is dropped on the floor, it will be as if the player had dropped them, they will disappear after 5 minutes.
  </p>
  
  <div class="tagged">
    <h3 id="dispensers">
      <strong>Dispensers</strong>
    </h3>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    Dispenser also eject items when triggered, but for many types of item they don&#8217;t just spit them out, they operate them as if the player had performed a right click.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Projectiles (arrows, eggs, snowballs, splash potions, fireworks etc.) will be fired rather than dropped.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A dispenser armed with a flint and steel will set fire to anything flammable in the block in front of it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If TNT is dispensed, it will be placed and ignited, and unless the dispenser is hanging over the edge of a high drop, it will be destroyed in the explosion.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If bonemeal is dispensed, it will fertilise any crops directly in front of the dispenser.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A dispenser containing a bucket of water or lava will place the water or or lava in front of it when triggered and if triggered again it will suck the water or lava back up.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A dispenser will place minecarts on rails or or boats on water, ready for the player to get in. If there is no rail or water in the right place, it will drop the item rather than placing it.
  </p>
  
  <div class="tagged" style="color: #222222;">
    <h2 id="hoppers">
      Hoppers
    </h2>
  </div>
  
  <p style="color: #222222;">
    Hoppers are devices that can collect items from the environment and transfer them to other containers. A redstone signal will switch a hopper OFF, and stop it from transferring items.
  </p>
  
  <div class="tagged">
    <h2 id="note-blocks">
      Note Blocks
    </h2>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    These play musical notes, which tune can be changed by right clicking them, and the block underneath the note block affects the instrument played.
  </p>
  
  <h2 id="minecart-rails">
    Minecart Rails
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    Three kinds of minecart rails respond to redstone signals.
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="curved-rails" style="color: #222222;">
    Curved rails
  </h3>
  
  <p style="color: #222222;">
    When rails are placed to form a junction, one of the rails will curve to connect, two of the tracks. A redstone signal will cause the curved rail to switch orientation, allowing tansportation in a different direction.
  </p>
  
  <div class="tagged">
    <h3 id="powered-rails">
      Powered Rails
    </h3>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    These rails push minecarts along the track when switched on, otherwise they act as brakes.
  </p>
  
  <div class="tagged" style="color: #222222;">
    <h3 id="activator-rails">
      Activator Rails
    </h3>
  </div>
  
  <p style="color: #222222;">
    These rails, when they are switched on, will activate certain types of minecart, such as causing a TNT minecart to explode.
  </p>
